## What is ADSB?
### Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) is an aviation surveillance technology and form of Electronic Conspicuity in which an aircraft (or other airborne vehicles such as drones approved to fit "ADS-B Out") determines its position via satellite navigation or other sensors and periodically broadcasts its position and other related data, enabling it to be tracked.
#### ADS-B enables improved safety by providing:
- Radar-like IFR separation in non-radar airspace
- Increased VFR flight following coverage
- ATC final approach and runway occupancy, reducing runway incursions on the ground
- More accurate search and rescue response
- Although ADS-B can transmit "aircraft down" data, the FAA has stated that there is no intention to perform even a study of ADS-B's effectiveness in an "aircraft down" situation, simply based on the fact that ADS-B equipment has no requirement to be crashworthy, as compared to the current "black box" recorder. 
- ADS-B was demonstrated to the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in March 2003 by AOPA via flight demonstrations for possible integration of the technology in CAP activities.
- Helps pilots to see and avoid other aircraft
- Cockpit final approach and runway occupancy
- Visual separation in VFR and MVFR conditions
- VFR-like separation in all weather conditions
- Real-time cockpit weather display
- Real-time cockpit airspace display

# ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) Overview

## Description

ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast, is a revolutionary surveillance technology transforming the aviation industry. By utilizing onboard satellite navigation systems, ADS-B enables aircraft to accurately determine their position and broadcast this information at regular intervals to ground stations and nearby aircraft.

### Key Features and Benefits

- **Radar-like IFR Separation in Non-radar Airspace**: Enables safe separation in areas with limited or no traditional radar coverage, enhancing safety in non-radar airspace.
  
- **Increased VFR Flight Following Coverage**: Enhances tracking and situational awareness for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations, improving flight following services.
  
- **ATC Final Approach and Runway Occupancy**: Provides precise tracking during critical flight phases, reducing runway incursions and enhancing ground safety.
  
- **Accurate Search and Rescue Response**: Facilitates quicker and more precise search and rescue operations by transmitting exact aircraft position and status during emergencies.
  
- **Collision Avoidance**: Assists pilots and Air Traffic Control (ATC) in detecting and avoiding potential collision risks through real-time position and velocity data.

- **Real-time Weather and Airspace Display**: Delivers real-time weather updates and airspace information directly to the cockpit, aiding in informed decision-making.
